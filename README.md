# bulma-scss

This is a port of the [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) project SASS
files to the SCSS syntax.

Currently, these files are based on Bulma version 0.6.2, and will be updated
with later releases.

I've converted these files using
[this script](https://gist.github.com/Prezto/e72e77e0f35352f5fcf5881b73b7d81b),
so you are free to perform the conversion yourself - I only thought I would
save others the trouble.
